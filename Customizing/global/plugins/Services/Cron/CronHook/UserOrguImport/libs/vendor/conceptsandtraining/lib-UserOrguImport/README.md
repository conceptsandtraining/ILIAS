# User- Orgu- Import Utilities
## Description
This library provides a set of tools to enable uniform org-unit and user imports.
It focusses on calculating the difference between the current state in target and
the desired state within some import source. The diferences are then applied using
tools providing by target (probably some ILIAS - plugin).
